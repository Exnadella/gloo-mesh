  - type: FIX
    description: >-
      Updated the extauth transport api to include new fields for matching the ext-auth-service transport version as
      well as the default envoy transport api version. This fixes future upgrades such that the default behavior can
      update as the ext-auth-service updates its transport api version with envoy. For users today, this is a non-change,
      since the old and new default are both using the v3 api, and the v3 yaml option is still honored.
